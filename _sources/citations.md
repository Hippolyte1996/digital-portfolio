```{tab-item} Things I learned
1. I learned a lot about formatting documents and Jupyter Book built from multiple documents. It is quite intuitive and reminds me of using LaTex for my graduate thesis a few years ago. 
2. I learned a lot about how interconnected files can be and that the data structure is really important to make projects easy to navigate and edit.

```{tab-item} Things I found difficult
1. I found that it is quite confusing to edit the metadata for a jypnb file when the kernel isn't exactly the same that we use in the course. I had to troubleshoot a lot before it worked without issues. 
2. I found that it's difficult to know whether you messed up something in your code when you build the Jupyter Book. By that I mean that if you made a mistake, fixing it is more difficult than when working with a file where you can check each cell individually.
